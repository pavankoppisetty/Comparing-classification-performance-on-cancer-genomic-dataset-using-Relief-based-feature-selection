# Comparing-classification-performance-on-cancer-genomic-dataset-using-Relief-based-feature-selection

This code has been run on the small dateset that was provided to us by our coaches. '4-wayAdditive_100feat' this was the dataset that I worked on. It compare the performance of verious machine learning algorithms on samll dataset for predicting binary outcomes.

# System requirements
It  need 3.10 or above version of python
with regular computational power
This code was build and tested on VS Code
All the cell need to be run serially
Data directory needs to update accordingly
